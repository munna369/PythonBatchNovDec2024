# PythonBatchNovDec2024
A repo of collection of python classes

##

to create a branch
    
    git checkout -b 'branch'

to check all branches

    git branch

to clone a repository(not needed for local development)

    git clone 'https url'

to stage the changes

    git status

to exactly see the changes made on single file

    git diff 

to stage the changes

    git add 'filename'

to commit the changes

    git commit -m 'commit message'
    
to push the changes

    git push origin ' branchname'

## PEP python enhancement proposal
     
     PEP 8 is a coding style guide

## CHMOD

    Used for ./ execution or to add file type to execution

python code written will create a python byte code working via interpreter which will pass to c compiler

 python is a dynamic typed language

 python data types float,tuple,complex,bool,strings etc.....

 indentation (errors caused becuase of tab spaces which are usually 4 for python)

 interactive mode vs script mode


## print escapes sequence

    \t for tab space, \n for new line, \b overwrites previous charecter \x hexadecimal value

## difference between keyword and identifier

    keywords are words which have meaning whereas identifier is user defiend variables

## keyword cannot be identifiers


## multiline statements

    lines should be 79 or less according to pep8
    semi colon  can be used to reduce code in less lines or end the statement

## python has no linit for storing values

## Run all will fail whenever there are expection

## abs value give positive or negative

## complex value > will have real and imaginary vlaue

    Library import math will import all math oprations (beacuse python doesnot have sqrt opertaion )


## Complex number > made to be complex :) complex number = real number +/- imaginary number pythin j is used to represent imajinary number

    0j is also complex number followed by j is complex 4j j4 j5 not possible

complex built in fucntion we can crete own complex numbers
